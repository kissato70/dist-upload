## `Examples`
**To configure the system, as the first step:**
```script
dist-upload-s3 -w
```
_The script will ask all the setup parameters and save it to the default config file._
<br><br>
**Creating a special config file (for example for staging):**
```script
dist-upload-s3 -c myTestConfig -w
```
_This will create a config file 'myTestconfig', which can be used for alternative uploads._
<br><br>
**Sending this complete startup setup along with the webpack config to the team:**
```bash
dist-upload-s3 -w -d dist  -b ourProdBucket -i ourProdBackup -m 5
dist-upload-s3 -w -d build -b ourTestBucket -i off -c stage
```
_The script will ask for the personal AWS access keys._<br>
_Hint: Place the above into the package.json under the 'scripts' like this:   `"init" : "dist-upload-s3 -w dist ..."`_
<br><br>
**Updating the config file, changing ONLY the given params**<br>
(In this example switching off the backup and changing the region):
```script
dist-upload-s3 -c myConfig -w -y -i off -r eu-west-1
```
&nbsp;<br>
**Uploading the folder 'test_build' (other than the folder set in config) in silent mode, while using the branch name 'stage':**
```bash
dist-upload-s3 -d test_build -S -f stage
```
&nbsp;<br>
**Listing the backup folder content, but only the last 3 versions:**
```bash
dist-upload-s3 -l 3
```
&nbsp;<br>
**Uploading the dist folder (as set in the config) by leaving only 5 older versions alive, without status messages:**
```bash
dist-upload-s3 -m 5 -S
```
_Any older versions above the number, will be deleted._
<br><br>
**Uploading to the previously configured staging area:**
```bash
dist-upload-s3 -c stage
```
